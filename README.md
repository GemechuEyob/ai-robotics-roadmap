# ðŸ¤– AI & Robotics Career Roadmap Projects

This repository contains all the key projects and experiments I'm building as I transition from a Data Engineer to an AI Engineer specialized in Robotics.

## âœ… How I'm Using This Repo

- Each folder corresponds to a monthly milestone project.
- Contains code, documentation, links to notebooks and demos.
- All projects include:
  - Clear `README.md` with goals, architecture, and learnings.
  - Code comments and lessons learned.
  - (Optional) Dockerfiles, CI pipelines, and deployed app links.

## ðŸ§  Learn Along

This repo is also part of my goal to "teach what I learn" â€” so each folder may include:
- Blog post links
- Video demos or screencasts
- Architecture diagrams

## ðŸ”— Resources
- Book Progress: Mathematics for ML, Hands-On ML, Practical MLOps
- Follow on Twitter / LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eyob-gemechu/
